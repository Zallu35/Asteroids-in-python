Second project on Boot.dev!

This one was pretty fun despite not having a ton of interest currently in game development. It's a very basic version of the classic game Asteroids made using python and pygame, move with wasd and shoot with space. 

Things I could try adding if I decided to explore game dev more in the future as suggested by Boot.dev (who knows if I ever will)

Add a scoring system
Implement multiple lives and respawning
Add an explosion effect for the asteroids
Add acceleration to the player movement
Make the objects wrap around the screen instead of disappearing
Add a background image
Create different weapon types
Make the asteroids lumpy instead of perfectly round
Make the ship have a triangular hit box instead of a circular one
Add a shield power-up
Add a speed power-up
Add bombs that can be dropped
